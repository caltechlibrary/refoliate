## Introduction

This is a command-line program that will take a folder of JSON files (assumed to be instance, holdings and item records previously downloaded from FOLIO) and (re)creates them in FOLIO via the API.


## Usage

```
REstore FOLIo sAved insTance rEcords.

This program takes a directory of JSON files previously downloaded from FOLIO
by a program such as Foliage.  The files are assumed to represent instance,
holdings, and item records that have been deleted from FOLIO. This program
proceeds to put the records back into FOLIO as-is, using the same UUID's
and all other fields.

If given the argument --continue, then errors involving the inability to
create a record (e.g., due to the record already existing in FOLIO) will make
this program continue execution; otherwise, by default, this program will
stop at the first error.

If given the -@ argument (/@ on Windows), this program will output a detailed
trace of what it is doing.  The debug trace will be sent to the given
destination, which can be '-' to indicate console output, or a file path to
send the output to a file.

If given the -V option (/V on Windows), this program will print the version
and other information, and exit without doing anything else.
